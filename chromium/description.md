SEPIA is an open-source, digital voice-assistant that runs on your own server, e.g. at home on a Raspberry Pi. The SEPIA cross-platform client that connects to your server works nicely as a stand-alone app in Chrome's kiosk mode (think of it as a smart-speaker with display), but this mode has no control buttons for browser tabs (obviously).
  
This extensions simply adds 2 additional functions to better handle kiosk mode apps:
  
- Switch the user-agent to Chrome mobile or any custom string
- Show/hide an additional navigation bar overlay (excluding localhost and SEPIA paths) to close tabs
  
More functions might be added over time as needed ;-)
  
The extension is open-source (like anything in SEPIA) and the code can be found here:
